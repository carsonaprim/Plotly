# Plotly
This project was intended to teach various methods of using plotly with javascript to show various versions of data drawn from subject's Bellybuttons. Bellybutton lint is being used to make cheeseburgers and the data is being drawn to test how competent it would be as a meat substitute. That isnt entirely a joke either, which is awesome.
